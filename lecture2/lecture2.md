# 27/01/2018 - 2nd Lecture

## Summary

We went over the homework.

### Network Effects

We discovered how valuable the networks around us for our professional development.

### Virtualization

We've seen pictures of computer parts and understood exactly what their doing.

Hard disk, Ram, CPU, CPU Cache.

We understood the evolution of virtualization components:

Server -> VM -> Docker (Container) -> Serverless (Function)

We installed an Ubuntu OS on VirtualBox.

## Networking

We've dismantled how the internet works with a "top down approach".

DNS. IP. Domains. TCP. UDP. CIDR. Private IP Space. IPv4, IPv4 Exhaustion,
IPv6, MAC Address. Bus, Hub, Switch, Router, DHCP. LAN. WAN. NAT. Subnet.

We've described the OSI Model (7 Layers ).

We understood how networks use subnet masks to figure out on what subnet they're on.

## Homework

1. Download Virtual Box. Download Ubuntu 18.04 from here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ubuntu-18.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso.
Install it. From now on use Ubuntu as your default machine - get out of your comfort zone.

2. Watch Mr. Robot.

3. Practice with https://www.typingclub.com. Reach at least 50 WPM.

4. Please do it - it will help you tremendously - Research and public speaking; find at least one security-related news article
and prepare a 2-3 minute talk about it.

5. Fill http://bit.ly/2B87gDw with your Twitter, Github, Linkedin.

6. Please read on Ethernet, IP, MAC Addresses.

7. Find the network address and the number of possible different IP addresses for:
    1. 172.31.191.100/25
    2. 172.24.23.56 Mask: 255.255.254.0
    3. 1.2.3.235/30

8. Challenge: How many subnets and hosts per subnet can you get from the network 192.168.78.0/26 ?

9. Tinker with your Home router and devices. Find the MAC address of your PC. Install Wireshark - and sniff the world.
