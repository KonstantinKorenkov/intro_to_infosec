## Summary

### Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal
- We learned what's a Bit, Nibble and Byte.
- We learned how to translate between:
    - Decimal to Binary
    - Binary to Decimal
    - Hexa to Decimal
    - Decimal to Hexa
    - Hexa to Binary
    - Binary to Hexa

### Networking & Sniffing

We've seen how Wireshark parses binary data with hexdump and protocol data.

### Computer Architecture

We explained the different components of a computer: CPU (AMD, Intel Core /
Pentium / Celeron, Arm), GPU, RAM, Harddisk (HD, SSD, NVMe), Motherboard,
Network Adapter, Operating System. ISA - Instruction Set Architecture.

### Virtualization

We've had an overview of virtualization. VMWare / VirtualBox and Docker.

## Terms

Parsing, Cloud Computing, GCP - Google Cloud Platform, AWS - Amazon Web Services,
RCE - Remote Code Execution, OS - Operating System, Packet, Hexdump, Network
Protocol, Simulate, Bit, Byte, Nibble. (Apologies, the cleaner cleaned the board before I could
take a picture of the terms. Don't worry - we'll probably use them again :) ).
