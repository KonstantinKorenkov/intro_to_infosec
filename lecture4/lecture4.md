## IP Routing

IP Routing protocols - BGP, OSPF, RIP, ISIS, EIGRP.

We understood how LANs and WANs work together.

## UDP / TCP

We understood the difference between UDP and TCP.

We used Wireshark to filter out specific UDP and TCP communictions.

(tcp.dstport == 443, udp.dstport == 53).

We understood why UDP is being used by DOS attacks (IP SRC Spoofing), and why
it's harder to achieve such spoofing with TCP.

## DNS Low Level

We studied how recursive DNS resolvers work.

We understood the difference between DNS record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT.

## HTTP and HTTPS

We understood that HTTP is a textual (as opposed to binary) protocol which
uses ASCII to send relevant protocol details such as HTTP Headers / Method / Path.

We understood that HTTPS is secure and uses TLS (SSL) which under the hood
employs public key cryptography.

## Terms
TLD - Top Level Domain, DOS (Denial of Service), ASCII, Hardening
